# Address Finder Application

This project was developed whith React to provide a solution where a company needed to allows the employee to find the addresses of customers based on their postcodes. Multiple addresses can be searched, so it was added the history of the last 3 in the page. Finally, alongside the address, was displayed the distance in a straight line, from the customer location to London Heathrow airport (lat/long: 51.4700223,-0.4542955) in both kilometers and miles.
