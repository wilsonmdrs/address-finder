# We are excited you are taking the time to solve our technical assignment! #

### Let’s pretend you are starting your first day with us. After you settle in, your first task will be assigned. Both Joseph (Product Owner) and Ness (Technical Lead) are ready to give you more details on your first task. ###

> Joseph - “Hi, I have your first task, excited?

> We need to create a web application that allows you to find the addresses of our customers based on their postcodes. Multiple addresses will be searched, so it would be nice if we could add the history of the last 3 in the page. Finally, alongside the address, we need to display the distance in a straight line, from the customer location to London Heathrow airport (lat/long: 51.4700223,-0.4542955) this should be displayed in both kilometers and miles.”

> Ness - “Ok, I understand the request and I think I can provide some help. I’ve heard about https://postcodes.io/, and we can use it as web service where we can type the postcode and we get the address details back, alongside the latitude and longitude. As its straight line it should be very easy to calculate the distance between the airport and the customer address.

### A working example for the web service is: http://api.postcodes.io/postcodes/N76RS

## A few examples of valid postcodes in the UK are:

| Index    | Postcode |          |
|----------|----------|----------|
| #1       | N76RS    |          |
| #2       | SW46TA   |          |
| #3       | SW1A     |          |
| #4       | W1B3AG   |          |
| #5       | PO63TD   |          |

     
	     
		 

I think a node + reactJS (or angularJS or vueJS) application would be an excellent idea use the tool you are more confortable with. There are definitely benefits to it but feel free to use other technologies/frameworks. Obviously if you want to use other frontend tools/technologies to help you achieve the work, I’m happy with it, but remember the focus must be as much in having it working as it should to have a good user experience, bonus points if you are able to produce a mockup and explain the reason why you used certain components. It is important the user understands all the functionalities we have to offer and is able to understand them correctly

Once you are done please commit the code and create a Pull Request so we can code review it.”

Now that the exercise has been explained, you can start working on it, we normally request for it to be uploaded into our git repository within 3 working days, but can be changed if you need more time to start. This task should take you no longer than 3 hours and needless to say should be totally completed by you, after all this is supposed to be a fun challenge!

## We will provide you a git repository in bitbucket for the code to be uploaded. Please see the instructions below:

Please sign up for an account on Bitbucket if you don't have one already. If you do, feel free to use your own login / profile.

If you're not familiar with GIT, use the Sourcetree client to get started or visit http://git-scm.com for the official git client.

Once you're done with your work, COMMIT and then PUSH (ie. send to bitbucket). The PUSH with notify us and we will review your work. Only push when you're done, and push once. This is to avoid us reviewing an incomplete submission.
